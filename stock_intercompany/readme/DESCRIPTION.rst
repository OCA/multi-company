This module allows to create counterpart transfers between companies defined in multi-company configuration.
For each company 'intercompany operation type' field must be set. Based on this, for each new picking from Company A to Company B (with destination location set to intercompany operation type of company B), a new counterpart draft picking creation on Company B side will be created.
