By default, the mail notifications with actions (such as "View Invoice", "Approve Leave" or "View Task") get base_url from the system parameter "web.base.url".
In multi-company, this is wrong since this parameter is server wide and not per company.
This module fixes that by:
1. using a company-specific url depending on the related record's company.
2. default to the system parameter "web.base.url" it the related record has no company field

Configuration
=============

* Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Companies*
* For each company that has its own odoo website, set the `Email Links URL`

Usage
=====

The module works correctly on emails where at least one link to an odoo
record exists, i.e. <a href="/foo?model=bar.zaz&res_id=1" ...>Link to record</>.
It will go over all links in the email html body and try to find one that has
a company with the web_base_url_mail field set. If it doesn't, it simply falls
back to the default behaviour of using the web.base.url configuration parameter.
