This module allows to manage intercompany pricelist, to sell products
between companies in a multi-company environnement.

Choose any company as the seller company, and for it, define a pricelist and flag it as intercompany. For a product P and its cost C, whenever you add a price on that intercompany pricelist, all other companies will get a new supplierinfo for P at price C.
