Odoo allows a journal entry to be posted in the same company. In a multi-company environment, it allows to have inter-company transactions at the sale order and purchase order level.

Some group/holding have setup a company structure where an employee is paid by a company of the group but is working part-time for another company of the group.

When the accounting team is loading the accounting entry for the payroll, the amount dedicated to the other companies needs to be transferred to those companies.
