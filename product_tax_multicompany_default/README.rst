This module sets the default company taxes for all the existing companies when
a product is created. It also adds a button in product view to set all the
taxes from other companies matching them by tax code.

Configuration
=============

#. As obvious, you need to have several companies.
#. Go to Invoicing > Configuration > Settings

#. User must have group Full Accounting Features (account.group_account_user)
#. Go to Invoicing > Customers > Products.
#. Create a new product and save it.
#. Switching user company you will see that the product has the default taxes
   for all the companies.
#. Change tax in a existing product
#. If Odoo detects divergent taxes across companies, you will see a "Propagate Taxes" button.
#. Click "Propagate Taxes" button
#. Switching user company you will see that the product has the same taxes
   for all the companies.

To propagate taxes in mass:

#. User must have group Full Accounting Features (account.group_account_user)
