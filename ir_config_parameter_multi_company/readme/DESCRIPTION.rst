This module enables you to associate to an ir.config_parameter, certain values based on the company that you currently have selected.
This is useful when you have a multi-company environment and you want to have different values for the same parameter depending on the company you are working with.

Other modules can force the company to use by setting `force_config_parameter_company` in context.
