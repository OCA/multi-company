This module enables you to associate to an ir.config_parameter, certain values based on the company that you currently have selected.
This is useful when you have a multi-company environment and you want to have different values for the same parameter depending on the company you are working with.

Usage
=====

Heading on the view of the desired ir.config_parameter, a new list has been added. 
This allows to select a company and associate a value with it. 
From now on, that ir.config_parameter will have that assigned value if that company is selected. 
This can also be done for multiple companies.
