Installation
============

This module uses the post and uninstall hooks for updating default product
template security rule. This only means that updating the module will not
restore the security rule this module changes. Only a complete removal and
reinstallation will serve.

Usage
=====

On the product form view, go to the "Information" tab, and put the companies
in which you want to use that product. If none is selected, the product will
be visible in all of them. The default value is the current one.
