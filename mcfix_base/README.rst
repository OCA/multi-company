This module is part of a set of modules that are intended to make sure that
the multi-company functionality is consistent.

It adds a computed field `current_company_id` to the `res.partner`, so that
property fields associated to this model, defined in other modules, will only
allow users to select values that are consistent with the company that the
user is currently working on.
