This module is useful if there are multiple companies in the same Odoo database and those companies sell goods or services among themselves.

It allows to create a sale order in company A from a purchase order in company B, and keep delivery/receipt pickings synced, including backorders.

When Company A sends a product tracked by lot or serial number, a new lot/serial number with the same name is created in Company B to match it, if one doesn't already exist.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Imagine you have company A and company B in the same Odoo database:


Company A purchases goods from company B.

Company A will create a purchase order with company B as supplier.

This module automates the creation of the sale order in company B with company A as customer.

Receipt picking(s) created from Company A purchase are synced with quantities delivered in picking(s) by Company B sale.

Usage
=====

Create a purchase with Company A, setting Company B as vendor > confirm PO > a SO for Company B with customer Company A is created automatically.


Validate SO for Company B > validate delivery picking > in PO for Company A, receipt picking is validated with quantities from Company B delivery picking.

If backorders have been created from delivery picking, they will be synchronized to receipt picking.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* No synchronization is made from the generated sale order back to the purchase order.
  This would be interesting in the case of price changes and discounts, that would be
  transmitted to the purchase so both documents couldn't have different total amounts,
  taxes, etc. A mechanism for synching from the sale to the purchase order would be
  needed.
