This module is useful if there are multiple companies in the same Odoo database and those companies sell goods or services among themselves.
It allows to create a sale order in company A from a purchase order in company B.

Imagine you have company A and company B in the same Odoo database:

* Company A purchase goods from company B.
* Company A will create a purchase order with company B as supplier.
* This module automate the creation of the sale order in company B with company A as customer.

Installation
============

If you want also to have different warehouses for your sales orders you can install `stock` and then `purchase_sale_stock_inter_company` will be auto installed.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:
#. go to the menu *General Settings > Companies > Companies*.
#. Select one of the companies.
#. Go to the tab *Inter-Company* then the group *Purchase To Sale*.
#. If you check the option *Sale Auto Validation* in the configuration of company B, then when you validate a *Purchase Order* in company A with company B as supplier, the *Sale Order* will be automatically validated in company B with company A as customer.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* No synchronization is made from the generated sale order back to the purchase order.
  This would be interesting in the case of price changes and discounts, that would be
  transmitted to the purchase so both documents couldn't have different total amounts,
  taxes, etc. A mechanism for synching from the sale to the purchase order would be
  needed.
