This module is useful if there are multiple companies in the same Odoo database and those companies sell goods or services among themselves.
It allows to create a sale order in company B from a purchase order in company A.
It also allows to create a purchase order in company A from a sale order in company B.

Imagine you have company B and company A in the same Odoo database:

* Company A purchase goods from company B.
* Company A will create a purchase order with company B as supplier.
* This module automates the creation of the sale order in company B with company A as customer.

Equally, purchase orders can be created:

* Company B sells goods to company A.
* Company B will create a sale order with company A as customer.
* This module automates the creation of the purchase order in company A with company B as supplier.
