- No synchronization is made from the generated sale order back to the
  purchase order. This would be interesting in the case of price changes
  and discounts, that would be transmitted to the purchase so both
  documents couldn't have different total amounts, taxes, etc. A
  mechanism for synching from the sale to the purchase order would be
  needed.
