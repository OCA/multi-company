This module allows to manage intercompany pricelist, to sell products
between companies in a multi-company environnement.

Choose any company as the seller company, and for it, define a pricelist and flag it as intercompany. For a product P and its cost C, whenever you add a price on that intercompany pricelist, all other companies will get a new supplierinfo for P at price C.

âš  Tips:

In case that you have multiple intercompany pricelist or intercompany pricelist with price per quantity, we deeply recommand you to install the module product_supplierinfo_group_intercompany in order to be able to manage the supplier order correctly.
Indeed Odoo supplierinfo order it broken by design when you have price per quantity !
The module product_supplierinfo_group reintroduce the supplier group concept and manage sequence on the group to solve it.
The module product_supplierinfo_group_intercompany is a glue module between this two modules and add the possibility to define a global sequence on the intercompany pricelist that will be applied on generated supplier group

Usage
=====

- go to Sales > Product > Pricelist and set a Company in a pricelist

- flag "Is Intercompany Supplier" is now visible; if enabled, a supplierinfo  will be created for each product:

1) which has an applicable pricelist line

2) where "Can be sold" and "Can be purchased" is set

- a supplierinfo will be created automatically for each new created product for which conditions above are verified

- the supplierinfo will be updated when pricelist or product is updated

- note: supplierinfo is not visible when using the same Company as the one set in "Is Intercompany Supplier" pricelist, unless technical group "Access to all supplier info" is enabled in user.
