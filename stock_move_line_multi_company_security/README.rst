In a multi-company enviroment, a user can access to all the companies product
moves from the product form *Product Moves* stat button. That's a full
disclosure of the companies operations which is a sensitive information that
gives accurate clues about what they sell, purchase or move internally.

This module adds the proper security to avoid it.
