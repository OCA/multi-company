This module extends the Odoo multi-company functionality to support auto-selection of company by the domain name of the URL used to access Odoo.

This allows you to have two browsers or browser tabs open at the same time, logged in as the same user, but with two different active companies. Instead of continually switching between companies, eg. when you need to input a quotation belonging to another company, you can just switch to the second tab immediately and input the quotation there.

You can, but don't have to configure a domain name on a company. Once a regular user accesses Odoo through this domain name, his active company for that session becomes that company. Any subsequent requests through that domain name will also use that company, however, the selection is not saved in the database - so on any other domain name Odoo will still exhibit the regular behaviour of using the company that the user last switched to manually.

As a practical example, we could have:

#. company1.hosting.co: always has company 1 active
#. company2.hosting.co: always has company 2 active
#. switchable.hosting.co: has the regular Odoo behaviour of being able to switch company, and the selection being remembered until switching again

Configuration
=============

This module is only useful when your installation has at least:

#. A multicompany configuration with two or more active companies
#. At least one user (not the superuser) with access to multiple companies
#. At least two different domains to point to your installation, eg. company1.hosting.co and company2.hosting.co. HTTP or HTTPS does not matter.

To configure this module, you need to:

#. In the Form View of a company, enter a domain name in the "Access domain name" field. When a regular user accesses Odoo through a URL with this domain name, his active company automatically changes to 

 

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Login as a regular user on two or more domain names on separate browser tabs
#. Be able to work in two or more companies at the same time by switching tabs

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Make an integration of this with the `website` module: select websites instead of having to type over domain names
* Make a version for the new multi-company in Odoo 13.0
* Validation on the domain name field: format, uniqueness, ..
