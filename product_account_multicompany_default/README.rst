This module extends the functionality of products and accounting to allow you
to propagate multi-company product accounts from the current company to all
other companies where you have access rights.

   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Install some module that lets you manage products, such as sale, purchase...
   (if not already installed).

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to a product's form view. It can be the product template or the variant.
#. Enter the "Accounting" tab.
#. Click on "Propagate expense/income account to other companies".

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Since this module propagates product accounts based on the account code, it
should only be used in a database where all companies belong to the same country.

We could add a wizard that allows the user to select multiple products and propagate
their accounts to multiple companies, in mass. This would improve the usability and fix
the issue on multi-country installations. Example:
