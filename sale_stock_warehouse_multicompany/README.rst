Allow multiple companies to sell the stock of a shared warehouse.

The sales order will belong to the company making the sale. As such, the taxes and related invoices will also belong to that selling company. The generated stock moves will belong to the company owning the stock and defined on the warehouse.

This approach also allows to use any route (like cross-docking or drop-shipment) on the sales order line.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
